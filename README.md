# Battleship

This project is a fully working Battleship game inside the command prompt. Players play against a simple AI. The player and the AI will take turns placing ships on their boards (The AI places ships randomly). The player and the AI have the option of placing ships horizontally or diagonally. The player can see his or her ships (left board) and the ships placed by the AI are hidden (right board). Each player has 7 ships with which they can place. To play, the user types in the column and the row they want to shoot at on the AI’s board. If the point shot at does not have a ship on it, a ‘W’ is displayed. If it has a ship, an ‘H’ is displayed. When the AI hits a ship, it then over the next four turns will proceed to hit the next four points of that ship. After it sinks the ship, the AI will resume shooting randomly again until it hits another ship. (This feature was added to make the game difficult). The player can type ‘S’ at any time to save their game. When the player loads the game again, they can then load their previous game and resume playing without any problems.
